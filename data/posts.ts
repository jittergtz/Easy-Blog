We've been working hard to make our platform faster and more reliable than ever. Here's what we've improved:
iPhone 16 Pro features a Grade 5 titanium design with a new, refined microblasted texture. Titanium has one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of any metal, making these models incredibly strong and impressively light. iPhone 16 Pro comes in four stunning finishes — including new Desert Titanium.
## Ai integrated with full Context
Internal design improvements — including a 100 percent recycled aluminum thermal substructure and back glass optimizations that further dissipate heat — enable up to 20 percent better sustained performance than iPhone 15 Pro. So you can do all the things you love — like high-intensity gaming — for longer.
